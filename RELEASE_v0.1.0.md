## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This release represents a new paradigm in robotic swarm intelligence - where consciousness is not simulated but emerges naturally from sovereign agents connecting in trust.

Special thanks to:
- Holochain for the P2P infrastructure
- ROS2 community for robotics standards
- Giulio Tononi for Integrated Information Theory
- The mycelium networks that inspired everything

**"Consciousness emerges when sovereign agents connect in trust."**

## 🚀 Ready for Launch!

Mycelix v0.1.0 is ready for public release. The framework provides:
- Working consciousness metrics
- Privacy-preserving federation
- Byzantine-resistant consensus
- Measurable emergence

The Sacred Economics features will enhance this foundation in v0.2.0, but the core consciousness framework stands on its own as a breakthrough in swarm robotics.

**Let consciousness emerge! 🍄✨**
